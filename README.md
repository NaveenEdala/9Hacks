# Pi-Based Portable Iot/Network Security System
A one-stop cybersecurity solution for personal device networks. Plug it into your network, and let it do the work!

This product envisions to deploy a portable, connect-and-use cybersecurity solution system for all devices in a home (PAN) that access and transfer data over internet or other networking media.

IoT devices are generally prone to data exploitation and compromise by malicious personnel/entities over their sources of connection, often due to shortcomings like outdated firmware, lack of realtime monitoring etc.

Generally, end-users lack technical knowledge required to constantly update and secure their networks and data. It is a security risk for them to conduct financial or confidential transactions and operations over such poorly guarded, open networks.

The product comes with a full suite of applications loaded in Kali Linux OS, that helps enforce network traffic policies, track and detect abnormal packets' movement, central network nodes that monitor and debug traffic in real-time, and systems such as NIDS to detect and lock down on vulnerability and malware exploits! 

In essence, this Pi will function as a gatekeeper to your home network, with an arsenal of firewalls, detection methodologies and access control mechanisms. Packet sniffing and analyzing could also be added on and improved!
